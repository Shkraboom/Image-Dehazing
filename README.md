# Image-Dehazing
Project on solving the problem of image dehazing using neural networks

## Terms of reference
There is a classical algorithm for image dichasing based on calculating the transmittance map t(x) of the image. this map takes a value between 0 and 1, where 0 - no light is completely transmitted, 1 - light is completely transmitted. this means that pixels where the influence of haze is high have the lowest t(x) value.
